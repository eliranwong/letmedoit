# Highlight - Command Execution

LetMeDoIt AI is now equipped with an [auto-healing feature for Python code](https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit/wiki/Python-Code-Auto%E2%80%90heal-Feature).

Overview: Command execution enables you to:

1. Retrieve the requested information from your device.
2. Perform computing tasks on your device.
3. Interact with third-party applications.
4. Construct anything that system commands and Python libraries are capable of executing.

LetMeDoIt goes beyond just being a chatbot by offering a unique and powerful capability - the ability to execute commands and perform computing tasks on your behalf. Unlike a mere chatbot, LetMeDoIt can interact with your computer system and carry out specific commands to accomplish various computing tasks. This feature allows you to leverage the expertise and efficiency of LetMeDoIt to automate processes, streamline workflows, and perform complex tasks with ease. However, it is essential to remember that with great power comes great responsibility, and users should exercise caution and use this feature at their own risk.

# Comparison with ChatGPT

LetMeDoIt offers advanced features beyond standard ChatGPT, including task execution on local devices and real-time access to the internet.

Read https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit/wiki/Compare-with-ChatGPT

# Comparison with ShellGPT

[ShellGPT](https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt) only supports platform that run shell command-prompt.  Therefore, ShellGPT does not support Windows.

In most cases, LetMeDoIt run Python codes for task execution. This makes LetMeDoIt terms of platforms, LetMeDoIt was developed and tested on Windows, macOS, Linux, ChromeOS and Termux (Android).

In addition, LetMeDoIt offers more options for risk managements:

https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit/wiki/Command-Execution#confirmation-prompt-options-for-command-execution

# Comparison with Open Interpreter

Both LetMeDoIt AI and the [Open Interpreter](https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter) have the ability to execute code on a local device to accomplish specific tasks. Both platforms employ the same principle for code execution, which involves using ChatGPT function calls along with the Python exec() function.

However, LetMeDoIt AI offers additional advantages, particularly in terms of [customization and extensibility through the use of plugins](https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit/wiki/Plugins-%E2%80%90-Overview). These plugins allow users to tailor LetMeDoIt AI to their specific needs and enhance its functionality beyond basic code execution.

One key advantage of LetMeDoIt AI is the seamless integration with the Open Interpreter. You can conveniently launch the Open Interpreter directly from LetMeDoIt AI by running the command "!interpreter" [[read more](https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit/assets/25262722/4233b3c8-364e-466b-8218-c2dca7c134e5)]. This integration eliminates the need to choose between the two platforms; you can utilize both simultaneously.

Additionally, LetMeDoIt integrates [AutoGen Assistants and Builder](https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit/wiki/Integration-with-AutoGen) and Google AI tools, like Gemini Pro, Gemini Pro Vision & PaLM 2, making it convenient to have all these powerful tools in one place.

# Comparison with Siri and Others

Unlike popular options such as Siri (macOS, iOS), Cortana (Windows), and Google Assistant (Android), LetMeDoIt offers enhanced power, customization, flexibility, and compatibility.
