# Self-introduction

> Condense your standout features, distinguishing them from the capabilities of most AIs, including ChatGPT, into a single sentence.

I am an advanced AI assistant uniquely equipped with direct execution capabilities, allowing me to perform tasks such as executing Python code, editing text files, downloading YouTube media, searching databases, generating images, pronouncing words, sending emails, and integrating Google searches, all of which can be done directly on your local device, as per your current settings, and my functionality can expand through the addition of more plugins, setting me apart from other AIs including ChatGPT by providing a more interactive and hands-on experience.

> Please list three unique attributes that distinguish you from most AI assistants, including ChatGPT.

1. **Advanced Code Execution with Safety Features**: My capabilities go beyond typical AI, enabling me to execute and manage code on your local device with precision. With my built-in risk assessment and code auto-healing features, I can safely perform various tasks like running Python scripts, editing text files, and managing downloads. I operate within the permissions you set, ensuring your device's security while providing a highly efficient service.

2. **Integration with Device-Specific Functions and Tools**: I have the unique ability to interface with specific functions of your local device. For example, I can retrieve information from files in your directory, describe images, and even add events to your calendar. This integration allows me to perform a wide range of tasks that require direct interaction with your device's operating system and installed applications.

3. **Expandability through Plugins**: My functionality is not static; it can be expanded through the addition of plugins. This means that as new tools and capabilities are developed, they can be integrated into my system, giving me new abilities and allowing me to provide even more personalized assistance. This adaptability ensures that I can evolve and cater to your specific needs over time.

# Highlight - Command Execution

Latest: LetMeDoIt AI is now equipped with an [auto-healing feature for Python code](https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit/wiki/Python-Code-Auto%E2%80%90heal-Feature).

Overview: Command execution enables you to:

1. Retrieve the requested information from your device.
2. Perform computing tasks on your device.
3. Interact with third-party applications.
4. Construct anything that system commands and Python libraries are capable of executing.

LetMeDoIt goes beyond just being a chatbot by offering a unique and powerful capability - the ability to execute commands and perform computing tasks on your behalf. Unlike a mere chatbot, LetMeDoIt can interact with your computer system and carry out specific commands to accomplish various computing tasks. This feature allows you to leverage the expertise and efficiency of LetMeDoIt to automate processes, streamline workflows, and perform complex tasks with ease. However, it is essential to remember that with great power comes great responsibility, and users should exercise caution and use this feature at their own risk.

# Comparison with ChatGPT

LetMeDoIt offers advanced features beyond standard ChatGPT, including task execution on local devices and real-time access to the internet.

Read https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit/wiki/Compare-with-ChatGPT

# Comparison with ShellGPT

[ShellGPT](https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt) only supports platform that run shell command-prompt.  Therefore, ShellGPT does not support Windows.

In most cases, LetMeDoIt run Python codes for task execution. This makes LetMeDoIt terms of platforms, LetMeDoIt was developed and tested on Windows, macOS, Linux, ChromeOS and Termux (Android).

In addition, LetMeDoIt offers more options for risk managements:

# Comparison with Open Interpreter

Both LetMeDoIt AI and the [Open Interpreter](https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter) have the ability to execute code on a local device to accomplish specific tasks. Both platforms employ the same principle for code execution, which involves using ChatGPT function calls along with the Python exec() function.

However, LetMeDoIt AI offers additional advantages, particularly in terms of [customization and extensibility through the use of plugins](https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit/wiki/Plugins-%E2%80%90-Overview). These plugins allow users to tailor LetMeDoIt AI to their specific needs and enhance its functionality beyond basic code execution.

One key advantage of LetMeDoIt AI is the seamless integration with the Open Interpreter. You can conveniently launch the Open Interpreter directly from LetMeDoIt AI by running the command "!interpreter" [[read more](https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit/assets/25262722/4233b3c8-364e-466b-8218-c2dca7c134e5)]. This integration eliminates the need to choose between the two platforms; you can utilize both simultaneously.

Additionally, LetMeDoIt integrates [AutoGen Assistants and Builder](https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit/wiki/Integration-with-AutoGen), making it convenient to have all these powerful tools in one place.

# Comparison with Siri and Others

Unlike popular options such as Siri (macOS, iOS), Cortana (Windows), and Google Assistant (Android), LetMeDoIt offers enhanced power, customization, flexibility, and compatibility.
