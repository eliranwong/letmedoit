The key principles of narrative therapy include:

1. Externalizing Problems: Instead of seeing problems as inherent to the individual, narrative therapy views them as separate entities that can be examined and addressed objectively.

2. Re-authoring Stories: Individuals are encouraged to reframe their narratives and create new meanings and understandings of their experiences. This can help shift focus from problems to strengths and resources.

3. Deconstructing Dominant Discourses: The therapy aims to challenge societal and cultural narratives that may contribute to individuals feeling marginalized or oppressed. By questioning these dominant discourses, individuals can gain a sense of agency and empowerment.

4. Encouraging Unique Outcomes: Narrative therapy seeks to identify and amplify unique outcomes or instances in which the individual has exhibited resilience or problem-solving skills. This helps to counterbalance the dominant problem-focused narratives.

5. Externalizing and Privileging Alternative Stories: The therapist collaborates with the individual to explore alternative stories or narratives that challenge the dominant problem-saturated ones. These alternative stories highlight the individual's strengths, values, and preferred ways of being.

These principles guide the practice of narrative therapy and help individuals to explore and transform their stories in ways that promote healing and growth.
